## General Information
- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- It is an attempt to create CNN model for Upgrad assignment
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- "Skin cancer ISIC The International Skin Imaging Collaboration" - Image dataset spanned across 9 classes related to various skin diseases.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- After handeling class imbalance the model validation accuracy improved significantly
